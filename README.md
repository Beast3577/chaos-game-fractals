Simple little customisable fractal generator made in Godot 4.4. 

It uses the chaos game to randomly pick a point from a specific number of vertices around a circle which make up a regular polygon, a point is then placed halfway between the last point and the chosen vertex. 
This is iterated upon indefinitely and makes some surprising and beautiful patterns.
